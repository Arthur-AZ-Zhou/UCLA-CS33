75% will hit the cache because the line buffer[i][j].r = 0; will always miss but the other ones hit, so 3/4 of the lines hit.

Create 4 nested for loops that test the code block by block. Let's use blocks of size 16 to transpose the elements. We would write this using 4 for loops 
having pseudocode like this:
for (int i = 0; i < dim - block_size; i += block_size)
    for (int j = 0 ...)
        for (int k = i; k < i + block_size; k++)
            for (int l = j ...)
                dst[l * dim + k] = src[k * dim + l];
